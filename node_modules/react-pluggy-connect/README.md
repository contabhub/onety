# React Pluggy Connect SDK

React Bindings for our [Pluggy Connect](https://github.com/pluggyai/pluggy-connect) widget.

## Setup

Using `npm`

```shell
npm install react-pluggy-connect
```

Using `yarn`

```shell
yarn add -S react-pluggy-connect
```

Import directly as an HTML `<script>`:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.pluggy.ai/react-pluggy-connect/v2.8.1/react-pluggy-connect.js"></script>
```

Additionally, you can refer to the `latest` release by referencing the URL like so:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.pluggy.ai/react-pluggy-connect/latest/react-pluggy-connect.js"></script>
```

## Usage

The following is a minimal example to get started. See below for more all the available
configurations.

For a more advanced, fully-working example you can use to get started right away, please check out
our Connect [Quickstart](https://github.com/pluggyai/quickstart/tree/master/frontend/react) repo.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import { PluggyConnect } from 'react-pluggy-connect';

const Index = () => {
  const onSuccess = (itemData) => {
    // do something with the financial data
  };

  const onError = (error) => {
    // handle the error
  };

  return (
    <PluggyConnect
      connectToken={'your-connect-token-here'}
      onSuccess={onSuccess}
      onError={onError}
    />
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<Index />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Typescript Support

This project was built using Typescript so all typings are natively built-in.

However, for up-to-date Pluggy API typings to work, you'll need to install `pluggy-js` in your
project as well, either as a dev or prod dependency.

```shell
npm install pluggy-js
```

## Cordova Support

If your project is using Cordova (ie. Ionic Framework), be sure to also install the
`cordova-plugin-inappbrowser` plugin.

This is necessary for links to be opened properly in the system browser, and for Oauth
redirects to work as expected, without blocking the main app frame.

```shell
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-inappbrowser
```

## Configurations

The available configuration props are the following.

See our official Pluggy Connect
widget [documentation](https://docs.pluggy.ai/#pluggy-connect-widget) for more detailed information.

### onEvent

This callback allows handling more specific events.

The property `event` inside the `payload` param of the onEvent callback, is the name of the current
event triggered.
The available events that can be handled through this method are:

| Event name               | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `'SUBMITTED_CONSENT'`    | User has confirmed terms & privacy consent on the first Welcome screen.                                                                                                  |
| `'SELECTED_INSTITUTION'` | User has selected an institution to connect to, or has deselected it (ie. navigated back to previous step).                                                              |
| `'SUBMITTED_LOGIN'`      | User has submitted credentials to create the connection Item.                                                                                                            |
| `'SUBMITTED_MFA'`        | User has submitted an extra parameter that has been requested by the institution to connect.                                                                             |
| `'LOGIN_SUCCESS'`        | User has submitted credentials to create the connection Item successfully.                                                                                               |
| `'LOGIN_MFA_SUCCESS'`    | User has submitted an extra parameter that has been requested by the institution to connect successfully.                                                                |
| `'LOGIN_STEP_COMPLETED'` | Successful completion of the login. User effectively logged in to the institution.                                                                                       |
| `'ITEM_RESPONSE'`        | Called every time the Item object is retrieved from Pluggy API, either when just created, updated, or each time it's retrieved to poll it's connection/execution status. |

`payload` object has a property timestamp and some events extra data:

`'SELECTED_INSTITUTION'` has the connector property which is the connector selected by the user.
`'LOGIN_SUCCESS' | 'LOGIN_MFA_SUCCESS' | 'LOGIN_STEP_COMPLETED' | 'ITEM_RESPONSE'` events have the
item property which is the item data related to the current connection.

Full `event` parameter type definition is:

```ts
type ConnectEventPayload = {
  timestamp: number;
} & (
  | {
      event: 'SUBMITTED_CONSENT' | 'SUBMITTED_LOGIN' | 'SUBMITTED_MFA';
    }
  | {
      event: 'SELECTED_INSTITUTION';
      connector: Connector | null;
    }
  | {
      event: 'LOGIN_SUCCESS' | 'LOGIN_MFA_SUCCESS' | 'LOGIN_STEP_COMPLETED' | 'ITEM_RESPONSE';
      item: Item;
    }
);
```
